[NeuGraph: Parallel Deep Neural Network Computation on Large Graphs](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc19-ma_0.pdf)
## Problems

* Neither the existing deep learning frameworks nor the existing graph systems could support GNN algorithms sufficiently.
* The lack of system support has seriously limited the ability to explore the full potentials of GNNs at scale.
## Motivation

* Advocate bridging deep learning systems and graph processing systems to enable a new framework for scalable GNN training.
* enable the DL frameworks to support efficient and scalable DNN computation on graphs.
* Supporting efficient and scalable parallel computation for GNN training is demanding due to its inherent complexi- ty. 
## Work

* They develop a system called NeuGraph which unifies graph computation and deep learning systems for GNNs.
